(This project is heavily relying on cocos. As I am not familiar with cocos, I am looking forward for your contribute to improve this project)

## 1. usage  

Although now the apk build from source is runable, it is not perfect. Beta version has some problems due to the cocos version change, incomplecate of some code. Currently the beta version is only aimed for debug. Please use [Kirikiroid2_yuri_1.3.9.apk](https://github.com/YuriSizuku/Kirikiroid2Yuri/releases/download/1.3.9_yuri/Kirikiroid2_yuri_1.3.9.apk) instead.  

## 2. Build  

I add some futures by reverse engine before, and now this project can be build from source.  This is really a very hard work, because there are so many dependencies, lack of files, code not compatible problems.  

### (1) prepare  

- wget, 7z, git, make, cmake  
- python2(for cocos2d-x v3), msys2 (if windows)  
- thirdparty depedency (see `_fetch.sh` in detail)  

``` shell
# wget

https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/opus/opus-1.3.1.tar.gz
https://downloads.xiph.org/releases/ogg/libogg-1.3.5.tar.gz
https://downloads.xiph.org/releases/opus/opusfile-0.12.tar.gz
https://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarsrc-6.0.7.tar.gz
https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.14.tar.gz

# git
https://github.com/krkrz/oniguruma
https://github.com/google/breakpad
https://github.com/zeas2/FFmpeg

# git with version
https://github.com/google/oboe/archive/refs/tags/1.7.0.tar.gz
https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/archive/refs/tags/1.23.0.tar.gz
https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/archive/refs/tags/2.1.5.1.tar.gz
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/refs/tags/4.7.0.tar.gz
https://github.com/lz4/lz4/archive/refs/tags/v1.9.4.tar.gz
https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/archive/refs/tags/v3.6.2.tar.gz
https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/archive/refs/tags/cocos2d-x-3.17.2.tar.gz
```

In windows, you must use msys2 to build ffmpeg port.  
You can also download the prebuild ports from [thirdparty_ports.tar.gz](https://github.com/YuriSizuku/Kirikiroid2Yuri/releases/download/deps/thirdparty_ports.tar.gz"), [thirdparty_build.tar.gz](https://github.com/YuriSizuku/Kirikiroid2Yuri/releases/download/deps/thirdparty_build.tar.gz).  

## (2) android  

- android sdk with `ANDROID_HOME` variable in env  
- android ndk 25.2.9519653  

See `_androida64.sh` for how to build dependencies.
Use `script/cross_android64.sh` to build ports and the use `project/android/gradlew assembleDebug` to build apk.

## 3. Compatibility  

|game|version|status|description|
|----|-------|------|-----------|

## 4. Issues (including solved)

(build from souce, beta version)  

major:  

- title path button click position is not correct
- crash in game menu form  
- game alert window button can not click  
- member GdiPlus does not exist
- global preference can not save

minor:  

- ~~android studio buildDir not worked and it make dir at root~~ fixed by cmake `add_subdirectory` build dir
